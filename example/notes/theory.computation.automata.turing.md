A **Turing Machine** is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine capable of simulating any algorithm.

## Components

- **Tape:** Infinitely long, divided into cells, each holding a symbol.
- **Head:** Reads and writes symbols on the tape and moves left or right.
- **State Register:** Stores the current state of the machine.
- **Table of Rules:** Dictates the machine's actions based on state and symbol.

## How It Works

1. The machine starts in an initial state with the head at a specific tape cell.
2. Based on the current state and tape symbol, it writes a symbol, moves the head, and transitions to a new state.
3. The process repeats until a halting state is reached.

## Importance

- Foundation of computability theory.
- Used to define what problems are solvable by computers.
- Basis for the Church-Turing thesis.

## Example

A Turing machine that increments a binary number on its tape.

## Applications

- Theoretical computer science
- Complexity theory
- Formal language analysis
